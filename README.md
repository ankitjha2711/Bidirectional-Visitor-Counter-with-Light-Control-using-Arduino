# Bidirectional-Visitor-Counter-with-Light-Control-using-Arduino

Introduction:
The demand for the electronic device which can control the room appliances has a great surge such that it can be implemented in many real time applications like in hotels, living room, garage and so on. The model can track the number of persons entering and leaving the room and also switches the lights and fans on and off if the room is engaged or vacant respectively. By employing this device in the room reduces the laborious work to search for the switch to light the room at once you enter. The persons entering the room through the entrance will be sensed by the Infrared Sensors (shortly IR sensors) and the signal sensed is sent to the Arduino UNO for processing and controlling the count in the room and also explicitly monitors the lights and fan in the room.

Scope:
The circuit which we have designed is simple and compact. With the help of some software tools, we were able to develop the required coding and burn it to the Integrated circuit.
The significance of the design and construction in this paper is enshrined in the fact that it provides the assurance of the health and safety of the occupants in a building at all time, since the visitors are guaranteed of traffic decongestion. It also provides accurate data for various research and analytical purposes as it generates the hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly report. The device helps to reduce pressure on building facilities by prompting security, when the capacity of the building is exceeded. It goes a long way to assist rescue teams or security services to come up with strategic procedures in dealing with emergency issues like people trapped in a structure as a result of hijacks and collapsed buildings which occurred recently at the West End Gate Mall in Kenya and Melcom in Ghana respectively.
